## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

Install the necessary dependencies by first creating a conda environment:

```
conda create -n "myenv" python=3.11.0
conda activate myenv
```
To install all dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“Š Prepare Datasets

Begin by downloading the required datasets. All datasets are available at [Autoformer](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZOYpTUa82_jCcxIdTmyr0LXQfvaM9vIy). Create a separate folder named `./data` under `src`. Then, place the downloaded contents under the new folder.

## ðŸ’» Training

For training we provide scripts under `./scripts`. Example usage:
```shell

## Acknowledgement
Our implementation adapts [Time-Series-Library](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library) and [Time-LLM](https://github.com/KimMeen/Time-LLM/) as the code base and we have extensively modified it for our purposes. We thank the authors for sharing their code.
